# Feature Specification: Notes CRUD, Conversations, and Categorization

**Feature Branch**: `001-right-now-you`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "right now, you are able to enter a note with a title and content. we need to start expanding on this:

- we need to add standard crud -> edit, delete.

- we need to add \"conversations\", where a conversation can consist of several notes.

- we need to be able to categorise both notes and conversations"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05

- Q: Can a single note belong to multiple conversations simultaneously, or is each note exclusive to one conversation? ‚Üí A: Each note belongs to at most one conversation (one-to-many relationship)
- Q: Can notes and conversations be assigned multiple categories simultaneously, or only a single category each? ‚Üí A: Items can have multiple categories (many-to-many tagging system)
- Q: How are categories created and managed? ‚Üí A: Hybrid (system provides default categories + users can add custom ones)
- Q: Do conversations have their own metadata (like title and description)? ‚Üí A: Yes - conversations have title and optional description
- Q: When a user deletes a note that belongs to a conversation, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Note is deleted immediately; conversation automatically updated

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users can manage their notes by creating, viewing, editing, and deleting individual notes. Users can organize related notes into conversations, creating a threaded discussion or collection of connected thoughts. Both individual notes and entire conversations can be organized using categories for better information management and retrieval.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Note CRUD Operations
1. **Given** a user has created a note, **When** they select the edit option for that note, **Then** they can modify the title and content and save the changes
2. **Given** a user has one or more notes, **When** they select the delete option for a note, **Then** the note is removed from the system (and automatically removed from its conversation if it belongs to one) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a confirmation dialog? Is deletion permanent or soft-delete?]
3. **Given** a user is viewing their notes, **When** they select a note to view, **Then** they can see the full title and content of that note

#### Conversation Management
4. **Given** a user wants to create a conversation, **When** they provide a title and optionally a description, **Then** a new conversation is created and they can add existing notes to it
5. **Given** a user is viewing a conversation, **When** they add a new note to the conversation, **Then** the note is created and associated with that conversation
6. **Given** a user has created a conversation, **When** they view that conversation, **Then** they can see the conversation title, description (if provided), and all notes belonging to that conversation in a structured format [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What order should notes appear in - chronological, manual ordering, or other?]
7. **Given** a user is viewing or editing a conversation, **When** they modify the title or description, **Then** the conversation metadata is updated

#### Categorization
8. **Given** a user is creating or editing a note, **When** they assign one or more categories to the note, **Then** the note is tagged with those categories
9. **Given** a user is creating or editing a conversation, **When** they assign one or more categories to the conversation, **Then** the conversation is tagged with those categories
10. **Given** a user has categorized notes and conversations, **When** they filter or search by category, **Then** they see all items tagged with that category (items may appear in multiple category filters if they have multiple tags)

### Edge Cases
- When a user deletes a note that belongs to a conversation, the note is permanently removed and the conversation is automatically updated (note count decreases)
- How does the system handle empty conversations (conversations with no notes)?
- What happens when a user deletes a custom category? (System-provided categories cannot be deleted) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are items un-categorized or reassigned?]
- What happens when a conversation has only one note and that note is deleted? (Conversation becomes empty but persists)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Note CRUD Operations
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to edit existing notes by modifying title and content
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to delete individual notes (deletion automatically removes the note from its conversation if applicable)
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to view the full details of any note they have created
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve the original creation timestamp when editing notes
- **FR-005**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should system track edit history or last modified timestamp?]

#### Conversation Management
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to create conversations by providing a required title and optional description
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to add existing notes to conversations (note: adding a note already in another conversation will move it to the new conversation, as each note belongs to at most one conversation)
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to create new notes directly within a conversation
- **FR-009**: System MUST display conversation title, description (if provided), and all notes belonging to a conversation when viewing that conversation
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to view a list of all their conversations
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to edit conversation title and description
- **FR-012**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Can users delete entire conversations? What happens to the notes?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow users to remove notes from conversations, making them standalone notes again

#### Categorization
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to assign multiple categories to individual notes (from both system-provided and user-created categories)
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow users to assign multiple categories to conversations (from both system-provided and user-created categories)
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow users to filter or search for notes by category (notes with multiple categories appear in results for any of their assigned categories)
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow users to filter or search for conversations by category (conversations with multiple categories appear in results for any of their assigned categories)
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide a set of default system categories available to all users
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow users to add and remove individual categories from notes and conversations without affecting other assigned categories
- **FR-020**: System MUST allow users to create custom categories for their personal use
- **FR-021**: System MUST allow users to edit the names of their custom categories
- **FR-022**: System MUST allow users to delete their custom categories (system categories cannot be deleted)
- **FR-023**: System MUST prevent users from modifying or deleting system-provided categories

#### Data Integrity
- **FR-024**: System MUST maintain referential integrity between notes and conversations
- **FR-025**: System MUST automatically update conversation note lists when notes are deleted (cascade deletion: deleting a note removes it from its conversation)
- **FR-026**: System MUST allow empty conversations to persist (conversations with zero notes remain valid)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Note**: Represents a single piece of content with a title and body. Can exist independently (standalone) or belong to exactly one conversation. Can be assigned to zero or more categories (many-to-many relationship). Has creation timestamp and potentially edit history.

- **Conversation**: Represents a collection of related notes. Has a one-to-many relationship with notes (one conversation contains zero or more notes; each note belongs to at most one conversation). Can be assigned to zero or more categories (many-to-many relationship). Contains metadata: required title and optional description.

- **Category**: Represents a classification or tag that can be applied to both notes and conversations. Has a many-to-many relationship with notes and conversations (one category can tag multiple items; one item can have multiple categories). Categories exist in two types: system-provided categories (available to all users, cannot be modified or deleted) and user-created custom categories (created and managed by individual users).

- **User**: The actor who owns and manages notes, conversations, and categories. All entities belong to a specific user.

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - 13 clarification points identified

**Key Uncertainties Requiring Clarification**:
1. Delete confirmation and permanence strategy
2. Note ordering within conversations
3. Single vs. multiple category assignment
4. Category creation and management approach
5. Conversation metadata and CRUD operations
6. Note-conversation relationship rules (exclusive vs. shared)
7. Cascade deletion behavior
8. Edit history tracking requirements

**Next Steps**: Address clarification points before proceeding to planning phase.
