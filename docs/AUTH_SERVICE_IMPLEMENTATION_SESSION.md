# Authentication Service Implementation Session

**Date:** August 17, 2025  
**Session Type:** Development & Architecture  
**Objective:** Design and implement centralized authentication service with cookie-based SSO

## 📋 **Session Overview**

This session focused on designing and implementing a comprehensive authentication service for the multi-application hosting platform. The key challenge was creating a system that works with the existing deployment constraints: 1 app = 1 repository and GitHub Actions-only deployment.

## 🎯 **Key Requirements Analyzed**

### Initial Requirements
- Common user system between all applications (app1, app2, future apps)
- Login dialogs and API for applications to authenticate against
- Ability to restrict access to specific apps
- Role-based system allowing different permissions per app per user
- Example: User's girlfriend can be admin of app1, user can be admin of app2

### Discovered Requirements
- No shared library dependencies (due to deployment constraints)
- Single sign-on experience across applications
- Secure authentication with modern best practices
- Zero-downtime deployment capability
- Integration with existing nginx/Docker infrastructure

## 🏗️ **Architecture Decision Process**

### Initial Proposal vs Final Solution

**Initial Proposal:**
- Separate auth service ✅ (Kept)
- Shared Angular library for auth components ❌ (Rejected)
- API-first design ✅ (Kept)
- Multi-tenant role system ✅ (Kept)

**Final Solution (Cookie-Based SSO):**
- Separate NestJS auth service
- HTTP-only secure cookies for token storage
- Domain-wide cookies (`.mhylle.com`) for SSO
- ~50 lines of code per application (no shared libraries)
- JWT tokens with app-scoped permissions

### Critical Architecture Insights

1. **Deployment Constraints Drive Design**
   - 1 app = 1 repository policy eliminated shared npm packages
   - GitHub Actions-only deployment required container-based solutions
   - Browser-native cookie sharing solved SSO without dependencies

2. **Security-First Approach**
   - HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks
   - SameSite=strict provides CSRF protection
   - bcrypt password hashing with 12+ salt rounds
   - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

3. **Multi-Tenant Role Model**
   - `user_app_roles` table with (user_id, app_id, role) tuples
   - JWT payload contains app access list and role mappings
   - Local authorization decisions without database calls

## 🛠️ **Implementation Details**

### Technologies Used
- **Backend:** NestJS 11 with TypeORM and PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** JWT with RS256 asymmetric signing
- **Frontend Integration:** Vanilla fetch API with credentials
- **Deployment:** Docker + GitHub Actions + nginx routing

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core user table
users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  first_name VARCHAR,
  last_name VARCHAR,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Multi-tenant role assignments  
user_app_roles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  app_id VARCHAR NOT NULL, -- 'app1', 'app2', etc.
  role VARCHAR NOT NULL,   -- 'admin', 'user', 'viewer' 
  granted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  granted_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  UNIQUE(user_id, app_id, role)
);
```

### JWT Token Structure
```json
{
  "sub": "user-uuid",
  "email": "user@example.com", 
  "apps": ["app1", "app2"],
  "roles": {
    "app1": ["admin"],
    "app2": ["user"]
  },
  "iat": 1640908800,
  "exp": 1640995200
}
```

### Cookie Configuration
```javascript
response.cookie('auth_token', jwtToken, {
  domain: '.mhylle.com',     // Available to all subdomains
  path: '/',                 // Available to all paths
  httpOnly: true,           // Prevents XSS attacks
  secure: true,             // HTTPS only
  sameSite: 'strict',       // CSRF protection
  maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 24 hours
});
```

## 🔄 **Authentication Flow**

### Initial Login Flow
```
User → App1 → Check Cookie → No Cookie Found → Show Login Form
User → Submit Credentials → App1 → POST /api/auth/login
Auth Service → Validate → Set Domain Cookie → Return User Info
App1 → Redirect to Protected Page
```

### Cross-App SSO Flow  
```
User → App2 → Check Cookie → Cookie Found → GET /api/auth/validate
Auth Service → Validate JWT → Return User + App2 Permissions
App2 → Show Interface (Already Logged In!)
```
