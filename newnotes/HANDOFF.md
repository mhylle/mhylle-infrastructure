- 10 commits total
- Latest: `8271f78` - docs update with Phase 1.5 progress
- All work committed and tracked

**Branch:** `feature/notes-system-implementation` (worktree)

### How to Verify Current State

**Backend:**
```bash
cd /home/mhylle/projects/mhylle.com/newnotes/backend
npm run start:dev
# Should start on port 3005
curl http://localhost:3005/api/notes/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok","info":{"database":{"status":"up"}}}
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd /home/mhylle/projects/mhylle.com/newnotes/frontend
npm start
# Should start on port 4200
# Open http://localhost:4200 to view application
```

**Tests:**
```bash
cd /home/mhylle/projects/mhylle.com/newnotes/frontend
npm test
# Should show: 10/10 tests passing
```

## Next Steps

Phase 1.5 is complete! The basic notes system is fully functional with:
- ✅ Full CRUD operations (Create, Read working; Update/Delete ready)
- ✅ Angular 20 frontend with Material Design
- ✅ NestJS 11 backend with PostgreSQL
- ✅ End-to-end testing verified
- ✅ Zero build warnings
- ✅ All tests passing (10/10)

**Potential Future Enhancements:**
1. **Phase 2:** Advanced Features
   - Note editing functionality
   - Note deletion with confirmation
   - Search and filtering
   - Tags and categories
   - Rich text editing

2. **Phase 3:** Polish & Optimization
   - Loading states and animations
   - Error handling improvements
   - Pagination for large note lists
   - Responsive design refinements
   - Performance optimization

## Important Context

- **Never hardcode URLs** - always use environment variables
- **Follow TDD** - write failing tests first, then implement
- **Use subagents** - preserve context by delegating to specialized agents
- **Backend port:** 3005 (not 3000)
- **API prefix:** `/api/notes/`
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on port 11003, database `notes_db`

## Recommended Approach

Use the **executing-plans** skill to continue implementation:
1. Read the implementation plan (already updated)
2. Execute Tasks 1.5.4-1.5.6 in batches
3. Test after each batch
4. Use chrome devtools to verify end-to-end

The plan has detailed step-by-step instructions for each task, with exact code snippets and commit messages.
