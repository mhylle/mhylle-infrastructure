# Routing Configuration Update

## Routes Added
- **Path**: `notes/:id`
- **Component**: NoteDetailComponent
- **Loading**: Lazy loaded via dynamic import
- **File**: `/frontend/src/app/app.routes.ts`

## Final Route Order

1. `''` → redirect to '/notes' (exact match)
2. `'notes'` → NoteListComponent (exact match)
3. `'notes/new'` → NoteEditorComponent (specific static path)
4. `'notes/edit/:id'` → NoteEditorComponent (specific static path with parameter)
5. `'notes/:id'` → NoteDetailComponent (parameterized path - LAST)

## Why Order Matters

### Angular Route Matching Strategy
Angular evaluates routes **in the order they are defined** and uses a **first-match-wins** strategy. The router stops at the first route that matches the URL path.

### Critical Ordering Rule
**Specific paths MUST come BEFORE parameterized paths.**

#### Why this order is correct:
1. **Specific paths first** (`notes/new`, `notes/edit/:id`): These have static segments that should be matched exactly
2. **Parameterized path last** (`notes/:id`): This is a catch-all for any ID value

#### What would happen with wrong order:
If `notes/:id` came before `notes/new`:
```typescript
// WRONG ORDER - DO NOT USE
{ path: 'notes/:id', ... }        // This would match first
{ path: 'notes/new', ... }        // This would NEVER be reached
```

When navigating to `/notes/new`:
- Angular would match `notes/:id` first
- It would treat "new" as the `:id` parameter value
- The NoteDetailComponent would try to load a note with ID "new"
- The actual `notes/new` route would never be reached

### Current Configuration Benefits
✅ `/notes/new` → Correctly routes to NoteEditorComponent (create mode)
✅ `/notes/edit/123` → Correctly routes to NoteEditorComponent (edit mode)
✅ `/notes/123` → Correctly routes to NoteDetailComponent (view mode)
✅ No route conflicts or ambiguity

## Implementation Details

### Route Configuration
```typescript
{
  path: 'notes/:id',
  loadComponent: () => import('./features/notes/note-detail/note-detail.component')
    .then(m => m.NoteDetailComponent)
}
```

### Features
- **Lazy Loading**: Component code is only loaded when route is accessed
- **Route Parameter**: The `:id` parameter is extracted in component via `ActivatedRoute`
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures correct component import path
- **Standalone Component**: Uses Angular 20's standalone component architecture

## Testing Verification

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate to `/notes` shows note list
- [ ] Click "New Note" navigates to `/notes/new`
- [ ] Click note title navigates to `/notes/:id`
- [ ] Click "Edit" from detail view navigates to `/notes/edit/:id`
- [ ] URL `/notes/new` does NOT match as note ID
- [ ] Back button works correctly from all routes

### Browser DevTools Verification
Use Chrome DevTools to verify:
1. Correct component loads for each route
2. Route parameters extracted correctly
3. No console errors on navigation
4. Lazy loading happens as expected
